This branch will always use the exact same mechanism for all versions. We will not fix any bugs in the bundler, so you will always get the same results. If we need to fix bugs or update the mechanism we will create a new branch for the updated mechanism. This way you can know that nothing will break without having to always find the latest tag. At the same time it is not a technical guarentee, so if you run a high-traffic website, you should still use tags.
